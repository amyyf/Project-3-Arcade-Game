Classic Arcade Game Clone
===============================

This project employs Object-Oriented Programming principles to recreate a favorite game.

This is the third project for my Front-End Nanodegree through [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001), for which I was awarded a merit scholarship by [Grow with Google](https://grow.google/).

There are [detailed instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true), if you're interested, but my task was to implement the object classes to enable gameplay. The images, HTML Canvas code, and game engine were provided.

## How to run the game

- Clone this repo and either:
  - Open the `index.html` file in your browser of choice
  - Serve the files locally through the terminal or via a browser extension like [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en)
- Go directly to its [page on my website](https://amyfrieson.com/arcade-game/)!

## How to play the game

1. Click the `start` button
2. Use the arrow keys to navigate your player around the board
3. Avoid the bugs
4. Reach the water!

### Dependencies

I used [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to transpile my `app.js` down to ES2015 for cross-browser compatibility - all browsers use the `app.min.js` file rather than my human-readable code.

### License

Since this is a student project, feel free to use the code or methods in the `app.js` file with attribution. I did build off [Udacity's code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game), though, so if you're using anything from the `engine.js` or `resources.js` files, that's theirs.
